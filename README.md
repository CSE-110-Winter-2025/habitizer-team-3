#### Iteration 1: 0.525 velocity
- Story #9:  Persist routines
A big portion of this milestone, and need to be tackled first, since many of the other tasks are tangentially related or even rely on this, since it is so high priority, we should tackle this first
- Story #10:  Pause and Resume Routine Timing
Since Story #14 relies on pause and resume, this needs to be done before we can do Story #14, making it an important task to get done early
- Story #11:  Create a Routine
This is also a high priority, and may require changes in our code base, so we should iron out what we need to finish earlier, and frontload in case this is more complex than expected
- Story #12:  Reordering Tasks in a Routine
This may be difficult since there could be many edge cases, and since the UI takes research, we should frontload this task, since we are expecting errors

8 + 12 + 8 + 2 = 30 hours in total for the iteration. We hope to complete more of the primary functionality of MS2 within the first week so we can fix any problems in iteration 2. 

#### Iteration 1 velocity calculation:
48 hours worked 
US12 + US11 + MS1 bugfixes / 48 = 20 / 48 = 0.417

#### Iteration 2: 0.417 velocity
- Story #9:  Persist routines
There were a lot of bugs in this story, and it still needs to be done as soon as possible
Estimated: 6 hours to fix
- Story #10:  Pause and Resume Routine Timing
The functionality of this story is working, just need some code refactoring
Estimated: 2 hours to fix
- Story #13:  Set Task time rounding behavior
This is simple to do, since it is basically one if statement extra to be added to what we have already coded up
- Story #14:  Handle App Force-Quit Properly
This relies on data persistence, so will need 9 to be done, and is low priority, so should be done when core functionality is done.
- Story #15:  Display Task Elapsed Times
This is relatively easy since we already have this coded, it just isnâ€™t displayed, so we should be able to do this towards the end

2 + 10 + 2 = 14 hours in total for the iteration. We are allocating less time for iteration 2 in prediction for extra timely bugs, incomplete previous iteration tasks, and upcoming finals.

Post Iteration 1: 14 + 6 + 2 = 22 hours now for this iteration
